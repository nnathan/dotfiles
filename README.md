# dotfiles

This is my collection of dotfiles for bash, neovim, mutt, and a few other programs. In some of the configs I've obscured the identities since they're being placed in a public git repository.

I've collected both dotfiles here. Don't use offlineimap because it's slow and clunky. It's not good for one shot backups which the mbsync config does a better job at.
